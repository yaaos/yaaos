# core/sse

> Redis-backed pub/sub for org-scoped general events and workspace-activity streams.

## Scope

- **Owns:** two pub/sub pipelines, channel naming, `serialize_for_sse`, Redis singleton lifecycle.
- **Does not own:** event persistence (none — Redis only); domain event definitions; auth enforcement (delegated to `core/auth` via `ORG_SCOPED` classification).
- **Boundary:** publishes land on Redis; subscribers consume via async iterators; no backpressure — slow consumers do not block publishers; no event persistence.

## Why / invariants

- **`publish_general_after_commit` ties publish lifetime to a transaction** — events are stashed on `session.info`; an `after_commit` listener drains and schedules them as `asyncio.create_task`. Rollback discards silently — rolled-back transactions never emit SPA events.
- **Channel isolation by org (+ workflow execution for activity)** — cross-org and cross-wfx events cannot leak by construction. Shapes: `{org_id}:general`, `{org_id}:workspace_activity:{workflow_execution_id}`.
- **`register_workspace_activity_ownership_check`** keeps `core/sse` from importing `domain/*`. App bootstrap wires `domain/orgs.assert_workflow_in_org` at boot.
- **`shutdown()` is registered with both web and worker shutdown registries** at import time — both processes host Redis subscriptions.

## Gotchas

- **`subscriber_count(channel)` is process-local** — not cluster-wide; don't use it for load decisions.
- **`reset_pubsub()` is for tests only** — drops the singleton synchronously; avoids the async `shutdown()` path in test teardown.
- **`reset_workspace_activity_ownership_check()` is for tests only** — lets tests wire their own ownership check without going through `app.web`.
- **Workspace-activity events are passed through unchanged** — no envelope, no `ts` stamping (unlike the general pipeline).
- **`/api/sse` prefix is `ORG_SCOPED`** in `core/auth/types.py` — all routes under `web.py` are auth-enforced without extra work.

## Data owned

None. Transport only — Redis is the substrate.

## How it's tested

`test/test_service.py` — publish/subscribe round-trip, fan-out, subscriber bookkeeping, singleton identity. Uses `redis_or_skip`.
`test/test_general_publish_service.py` — rollback discards events; commit delivers with correct shape; org isolation. Uses `db_session` + `redis_or_skip`.
`test/test_workspace_activity_publish_service.py` — cross-org and cross-wfx isolation.
`test/test_general_endpoint_service.py` — HTTP auth gate (401/400/403); cross-org isolation on `_general_stream` directly.
`test/test_workspace_activity_endpoint_service.py` — cross-org 404; happy-path streaming via `_workspace_activity_stream`.
`test/test_serialize_for_sse_service.py` — `data: <json>\n\n` shape.
`test/test_shutdown*.py` — singleton lifecycle and shutdown-hook registration.
