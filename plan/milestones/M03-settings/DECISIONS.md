# M03 — decisions made during autonomous run

> Append-only log of decisions made when the spec was ambiguous and certainty was below 3 of 5. Per [START_HERE.md § Decision protocol](START_HERE.md#decision-protocol).

## Format

Each entry:

```
### <Phase N> — <one-line decision summary>

- **Certainty**: <1 or 2>/5
- **Decision**: <what was chosen>
- **Alternatives considered**: <brief>
- **Why this one**: <one line>
- **Reversal cost**: <low/medium/high — how painful to undo later>
```

Keep entries terse. The user reads this at the end of the run; volume = friction.
